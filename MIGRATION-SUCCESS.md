# ✅ Migration Successful!

## Status

Your NixOS configuration has been successfully migrated to a declarative, modular architecture.

## What's Working

### ✅ Core Services
- **Docker**: Active and running
- **SSH**: Active and running
- **Home Manager**: Successfully managing user environment
- **Neovim**: Installed via Home Manager at `/etc/profiles/per-user/dev/bin/nvim`

### ✅ Configuration Structure
- Modular design with 6 specialized modules
- Home Manager managing user packages and dotfiles
- Declarative Neovim configuration
- Docker module with options
- Power management settings

### ✅ Key Improvements Applied
1. **User environment** now managed by Home Manager
2. **Neovim config** is declarative (backed up old config to `init.lua.backup`)
3. **Bun** installed via Nix packages (no PATH hacks)
4. **Modular configuration** with reusable components
5. **Compatible versions** using home-manager release-24.11 branch

## Issues Resolved

### NetworkManager-wait-online
- **Status**: Fixed - service disabled via networkmanager-fix.nix module
- **Solution**: Created module to override the service completely
- **Result**: No more error messages on rebuild

### Home Manager Service
- **Status**: Inactive (normal - runs once at activation)
- **Files backed up**: Conflicting files have `.hm-backup` extension

## Files Changed

```
/home/dev/nixos/
├── flake.nix                  # Updated with release-24.11 home-manager
├── configuration.nix          # Modularized system config
├── home-manager/dev.nix       # User environment configuration
└── modules/                   # 6 specialized modules
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test your applications**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   nvim --version
   tmux
   ```

2. **Check Home Manager packages**:
   ```bash
   home-manager packages
   ```

3. **Old config backups**:
   - Neovim: `/home/dev/.config/nvim/init.lua.backup`
   - System: `/home/dev/nixos-backup-*`

## Rollback if Needed

If you encounter any issues:
```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback
```
